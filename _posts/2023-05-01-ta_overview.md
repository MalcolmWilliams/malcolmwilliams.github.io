This is the first in a series of posts about the South Island of the Te Araroa trail. As there are already many excellent resources online for through hiking and the Te Araroa, this is not intended to be a guide. Rather, this series of posts documents my general approach to hiking. Creating a blog post was inspired by reading [Michael Deckerbach's](https://www.michaeldeckebach.com/) posts regarding the TA.

## Trip Description and Basic Stats

When I decided to head to New Zealand to hike, I explicitly intended to not directly follow the TA. My goal was to do a large amount of high quality, multi day hiking, meet new people and experience beautiful scenery. The TA provides an excellent rough overall plan that can be followed. This cuts down on the amount of planning that I am required to do. I am very content to skip any sections that I think might not line up with my objectives, and as a matter of fact I put this to the test immediately when I skipped the first day from Bluff to Invercargill, opting instead to start directly on Oreti beach.

My quick review of the trip would be a definite 10/10. It was an incredible experience and something I will remember for the rest of my life. The basic stats of "my" TA:
- Trip duration: 9 weeks
- KM walked: 1000km
- KM walked on roads: < 10km
- Money Spent in total: 10k CAD
- Longest hiking stretch: 9 days

## Tent vs Hut
The hut system is one of the most talked about and loved features of the TA. However, as the trail has gained a huge amount of popularity in recent years (I walked in 2023), overcrowding has become a real issue. I heard stories of huts bursting at the seams with two or even three times the number of people compared to the available beds. By the end of a trip it had almost become a game to see how many ridiculous and impractical locations we could choose for wild camping. When tenting in a beautiful location there was always a little less comfort compared to a hut, but I would argue I overall slept better due to not being awoken by others in the hut. A sunset and/or a sunrise from a nice tent location provides a more immersive experience than a hut.

To be clear, none of this is to say that the huts were not hugely appreciated, or I did not use them. Meeting people at the huts while relaxing and chatting was a real highlight of the trip. Additionally the value they provide as shelter from inclement weather cannot be understated. There is nothing more appreciated than arriving at a dry hut after a day of hard rain. By the end of the trip (late March/early April in the Richmonds) there were not many hikers on the trail and the weather was significantly colder. The huts were definitely very appreciated then!

## Ultralight
Researching for this trip was my first real introduction to ultralight hiking. I began by creating a spreadsheet of my existing geat with the weights of each item. This helped me identify items that could either be left behind or be replaced with lighter weight alternatives. This was also a useful exercise to help determine what your actual goals are for the hike. For example, you can opt to leave a stove behind to save weight, but at the cost of warm meals. What is more valuable to you, an easier time hiking more kilometers, or a luxurious coffee in the morning?

When considering ultralight gear there are also environmental considerations to keep in mind. While I think that everyone _should_ be environmentally concious, I think those that hike or do other outdoors activities should be doubly motivated. It would be highly hipocritical and selfish to not be. Some ultralight equipment is notoriously flimsy which overall can create unnecessary waste in the long run. Additionally, I would consider it much more responsible to modify or simply make do with equipment that you already have. In my opinion a minor weight loss, say on the order of 100 grams, is very hard to justify. Once I really considered

One thing I do strongly agree with is using equipment that is not necessarily intended for hiking. A plastic waster bottle is an excellent example. The economies of scale are certainly on your side in this situation. It would be nigh impossible for a small hiking company to develop a better waterbottle than a large company producing millions. The goals of a commercial waterbottle also align well with hiking goals - lightest weight possible, while still being durable _enough_.

While on the subject of water, another technique I found to be very useful was not carrying an excessive amount of water. By either looking at the topo maps, Far Out, or talking to other hikers you can gain a very accurate idea of where the available water sources are. Through the south island there are only a few sections that you would need to carry more than 500ml at a time. This is a very significant weight savings right there. In order for it to be feasible to do, your waterbottle must be within easy reach. This precludes a water bladder. In most areas I did not bother filtering either. I of course started by filtering, but as I talked to other hikers and saw what they were doing gradually dropped the practice. I would however still say that a filter is essential.

Over the course of the hike I gradually accumulated _things_. By the end I was certainly not ultralight, and maybe not even light. But, I was happy.

The most important conclusion I arrived at was that it really doesn't matter how someone chooses to hike. The most important thing is to have a good time.

## North Island Vs South Island, Nobo vs Sobo

I went into this hike knowing I could reasonably take 2-3 months. Considering the cost and time to travel from Canada to New Zealand, anything less than 3 weeks is a difficult sell. Since I was taking time off work, I did not want to go much longer than 2 months either. These decisions having been made, I knew I could not do both islands. From research online, and conversations with other hikers, the South Island was the obvious choice. I did not end up spending any time on the North Island at all. I heard multiple suggestions to consider section hiking the North. There are certainly some very beautiful places, and from what I could tell some places that were unique to New Zealand. However, due to the high percentage of private land ownership wild camping becomes much more difficult. If I were to do it again, I think I would allocate some extra time to visit the North Island with a rental car or bike. The prevailing opinion seemed to be that the North is simply not well setup for through hiking, and I do not see this changing in the immediate future.

The final decision to make was whether to hike northbound or southbound. Since I was only hiking one of the islands, I did not have to be very concerned with the hiking seasons. I was starting relatively late in the season (at the start of February). By the end (April 6), the days were noticeably shorter and colder. Frost in the mornings was not uncommon throughout the Richmonds and Nelson Lakes. The conditions were however excellent throughout. Since I was also only hiking the South Island, I did not have to be concerned with the direction of the Whanganui River. In my opinion, heading northbound has two main advantages. First of all, it is simply an easier start with low elevation gains, and towns more closeby. This gives you an opportunity to develop some fitness and learn how to provision properly. Secondly, the sections often regarded as the most beautiful, IE Nelson Lakes and the Richmonds are towards the end of your hike. So you are constantly pleasantly surprised and impressed by what is around you.

## Budget Breakdown

For reference for others considering a similar trip, I've sorted through my credit card statements and spent the following (slightly shocking) amount:

| Category  | Amount [CAD] |
|-----------|--------------|
| Gear      |         2200 |
| Food      |         2600 |
| Housing   |         1100 |
| Transport |         3500 |
| Misc      |          500 |
| Total     |        10000 |

### Gear:
I will go further into my gear in the next section. This total includes Items that I purchased shortly before or during the trip. They include:
- Tent
- Quilt
- Liner
- 2x pairs of shoes
- Stove

### Food
Food in new zealand is expensive. I would regularly spend > 200$ for a week of food. Shopping at larger stores and using bounce boxes certainly helps. When hiking you don't have a huge number of luxuries to look forward to. Food is a big one, and in my opinion not worth skimping on. A pretty significant portion of this amount is also spent at restaurants/coffee shops in towns. Generally only 1 night would be spent in town, but it is still enough to add up.

Hiker hunger is also a real thing. When starting out I would use an app (MyFitnessPal/MyNetDairy) to count calories. This was helpful as I just didn't have the experience to look at a shopping cart and be confident it contained the right amount of food. On average I found I would eat ~5000 calories per day.

### Housing
I opted to not sleep at a holiday park/campground when in town, instead opting for hostels/cheap hotels when available. The relatively small number of days spent in town (except for a few days at the end of the trip) meant that this total was relatively small. This total also includes the DOC hut pass, and other paid campsites (such as on the great walks)

### Transport
The lions share of this is flights to/from New Zealand. Canada is quite far away. Hitch hiking or public transit was used often.


## Gear Breakdown

As can be seen on other parts of this website, I enjoy tools. Hiking gear is no different. Additionally, when you spend so much time with your equipment you have a lot of time to think about how it performs, what deficiencies there are, and what improvements may be possible. As much as possible I tried to use equipment that I already had, even if it was heavier than what is available elsewhere. For the items I did opt to upgrade, I tried to make sure they were of high quality.
