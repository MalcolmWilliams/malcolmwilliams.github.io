This post describes the build process and thoughts for future improvements of a skin on frame kayak. 6 years later I am still using it regularly and it has been an excellent performer. The boat was christened in Washington state, used many summers in Ontario and was brought to Newfoundland for a summer where it finally tasted salt water and was used almost daily.

I did not start with the idea of building a kayak, it actually went through a few evolutions. My girlfriend at the time had a project in second year university to build a boat out of cardboard and duct tape. I though this sounded like a very fun idea, and had some thoughts about how I would go about building it. I was talking about this with a friend and we dediced we should just build our own. This got slightly out of hand and our ambition grew. Instead of building a small boat, we would build a full sized boat out of cardboard and duct tape and float down a river near where we were living. We then said to ourselves "if we're going to build a full sized boat, we might as well make one that will last. It won't be much more difficult".

That evening we orders "How to build a Greenland Kayak" by Chris Cunningham off of Amazon. Less than a week later we were doing the several hour drive to my parents place to stay there for a week during reading week and build some boats. We sutdied the book while driving. I was fortunate to grow up being taught woodworking by my dad, who has a well equiped shop in the basement.

We started by scrounging in the garage for all the material required. We had a number of suitable pieces of maple for some of the larger deck beams (Masic), Cedar from and old fence and various pieces of pine for the bow, stern and less structurally important deck members.

Some of the specialty wood, such as a 16ft by 0.75 inch by 12 inch piece of clear, straight grained Cedar was no just lying around. The cedar is for the gunnels, chines and keel. You don't need a 12inch wide section as you will be cutting them down to widths of 2.5inch (2pcs), 0.75 inch (4pcs), and 1 inch (1pcs) respectively. It is however very important that the stock is of the highest quality because this will directly translate to the quality of the boat. Thankfully Ottawa has some great specialty wood stores so we were able to pick up everything required. We also got a clear straight grained 2x4 by 8ft piece of douglas fir for a paddle, and ash for the ribs and cockpit coaming. The ash was unfortunately already kiln dried so it did not steam bend very well, but we muddled through.

We then visited a local leathermaking store and picked up the Latigo leather strips required for the deck fastening and the waxed nylon for the lashings.

With all the purchases out of the way it was time to get started. Our initial goal was to complete the frames within the week where we had access to all the tools. I find the kayak fascinating because it really does not require any power tools or a huge shop, but having access to this certainly makes things easier.

The first step was to cut down the long cedar sections into the gunnels, chines and keel as mentioned above. The main planning happens in the gunnels. Here you lay out where the ribs are going to lie and where the deck beams are going to lie. You start by building two jigs for the ends of the gunnels that will hold them at the correct angle and spreading from the middle. At each deck beam localtion you can now measure and rough cut your stock before more precisely fitting it. As with any boat building you are always working with coumpound angles and doing your best to keep things fair. Sighting became more important than measuring and it was a process to relearn how to woodwork. What you are seeing in front of you becomes much more important than dimensions on the drawing.

There are many ways the deck beams could be attached. These small decisions occupied a large amout of time during the build process. If there was an experienced boat builder at our disposal it would have saved a lot of time, but as it was we just had to do the best we could. We decided to use two dowels installed at angles. The angle prevents the beam being joined from being able to directly pull out. A small split and a narrow wedge was inserted into the end of the dowel once it was fully seated. When the wedge is hammered in the end of the pin expands , locking it in to the hole. It's very important to make sure that you are paying attention to the grain direction here. The wedge provides tremendous mechanical advantage and can easily split the gunnels. To further keep the deck beams from pulling out they are lashed in which pulls them down and tigheter to the gunnels. The tight wrapping of the skin helps to keep the gunnels from spreading apart and also helps keep the pins from working their ways out.

One of my main gripes is the location of the deck beams. When touring the internal volume of the kayak is very small. Instead of having the beams near the center of the gunnels, I would move them closer to the top and keep them slightly curved. This would not change the actual internal volume of the boat, but would make it infinitely easier to pack. The current location of the beams interferes with trying to shove gear into the boat. Additionally slightly curving them would improve the ability to shed water, particularly on the bow. I have had a few instances where the boat has started to submarine. Keeping the deck relatively flat is definitely nice for gear storage. It is a pain to reach in to the boat for gear while you are on the water.

One of the main themes in the skin on frame kayak is the lack of glue, screws or nails throughout the entire build. This, combined with the skin that remains pliable allows the entire boat to flex to absorb and dissipate shock. In theory this allows the build to be lighter while still remaining sufficiently strong versus a similar rigid design. There are of course a few places were I cheated here. Firstly, I epoxied on some skegs at the bow and stern to provide a little more rub protection. Secondly, when entering and exiting the kayak you sit on the deckbeams immediately aft of the cockpit. I epoxied on some reinforcing triangles to the gunnels. The weight of your body puts a large load on the dowels holding the deck beams on. These gussets are only glued to the gunnels, so the flexibility is retained but they are still close enough that when you sit on the deck beams they can settle on the gussets and transmit the load directly to the gunnels.

After the deck beams are installed it is time to start on the ribs. The first step is to prepare all the stock to width, and then cut it to length. The book provided formulas for lengths that would provide a fair curve. We repurposed a kettle and some ductiting to build a steaming rig. Steaming was fun as you had to work quickly so there was no overthinking, only instinct. Thankfully it's a small penalty if you ruin a rib and need to restart. The tight curves near the bow and stern were particularly challenging. In the end I had to thin out the section to be bent. Pockets for all the ribs were routed into the gunnels before installation of the deck beams which made it very convenient to fit the ribs as you are working. Thin dowels (bamboo skewers) were used to hold the ribs from falliing out. In theory the skin would be sufficient to prevent this, but it seemed very prudent to have some positive retention. We also lashed the ribs in, this I would say is definitely not required if you are also pinning them. If I had to choose I would take a lashing over a pin any day. Pins are weaker, weaken the wood around them and are more liable to work their way out. They are however quicker to install.

The transom and bow are made with solid pieces planks of pine. This is another aspect of the design I am not sure about. Even with holes cut in the plank they are heavy. The grain is not in a great orientation so I think it is quite weak, and this seems like a major deviation from the greenland designs. I'd like to spend time studying other designs to come up with some alternative suggestions.

With the exception of the coaming these are the major frame structures, and the major woodworking complete. Excellent timing because the week was up and it was time to return to University. With litterally only an inch to spare we were able to manuever the semi completed frames out of the living room and strap them on the car. The chines and keel was not installed, nor were the ribs pinned and lashed so we could disassemble the frames and easily transport everthing. Over the course of the next few weeks I picked away at small bits and pieces while studying. Come exam time I got more serious with the build (and the procrastination from studying) and completed the frame. The keel and chines are lashed on with the help of a series of fairing blocks. I think that ideally you would not want to use any fairing blocks as if you are really good with your rib bending you will end up with a fair hull. Regardless I made sure with the help of a bedsheet to visualize the shape I was going to end up with a pleasing hull. At this point the project was very "real" and I spent quite a lot of time sitting in the half completed frame pretending I was paddling.

The final step on the frame was to apply several coats of tung oil to help preserve it. The material choice of primarily cedar means that there should be good rot resistance naturally, but making sure the boat remains dry while in storage is something I am very careful about. As the frame will be covered with a skin and will not be accessible there are not any oportunities to reapply. Tung oil remains slightly flexible and has good penetrating properties so it is prefered to varnish in this use case which is quite brittle and can crack.

It was now the spring of 2017 and I had an internship in Vancouver. A friend and I decided to road trip so I again put the frame, now complete, on the roof of the car and drove the several thousand kilometers out.

I was working at General Fusion and they were gracious enough to allow me to use tools after hours and store the boat on premise. People were very excited for the project and encouraging. I still had a paddle to make, the coaming, and sew and coat the skin. The paddle was relatively straightforware woodworking.

Future extensions.
Another kayak, with more focus on sailing.
A woods kayak that is built using only primitive tools and basic materials. Think nothing more than a tarp, string and an axe.
