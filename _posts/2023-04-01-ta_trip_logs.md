This post is part of a short series that I wrote on hiking part of the Te Araroa trail in New Zealand.

Other posts can be found here:

These trip logs detail each section of the trip. I only walked the South Island, but did take any alternate routes that I thought were interested. As explained in the overview, I though of the TA as more of a guideline than a strict path to follow.

To jump directly to a section,  click on one of the links below:
- Oreti Beach to Colac Bay
- Longwoods and Takitimus
- Kepler Track
- Mararoa River and Mavora Lakes
- Motatapus
- Wanaka, Hawea, Breast Hill, Melinda Ridge, Ahuriri river
- Mt Cook, Ohau to Tekapo
- Two Thumb Range, Stag Saddle,
- Arthurs Pass
- Nelson Lakes
- Richmond Ranges

## Oreti Beach to Colac Bay
Part of the reason why I decided to go northbound was the easier start. The beaches don't receive much love as they are generally flat and deemed "uninteresting". They are flat, but the walking is easy as the sand is quite compacted. I would also say they are quite interesting - on your left you can see Stewart Island, and in the distance you can see the various hills slowly approaching.

## Longwoods and Takitimus
The Longwoods have quite a reputation for mud. This is certainly true, but depending on where else you have hiked in the world it is not anything unexpected. I was also passing through them towards the end of the season, so I suspect that it could have been worse. Additionally, some of the tops can easily get cloudy and have drastically reduced visibility. I did not have this occur to me, but could easily see how people could become lost. The trail was well marked with poles, but the path was not very visible due to the grass and fast growing bushes.

Shortly after Merrivale hut a friend and I tried our hands at hitching for the first time. It was a success - within a few minutes a kind gentleman from the Riverton bakery picked us up and offered some useful hints along the way. After the Birchwood Station and a stop in Nightcaps (with some restocking along the way) it was on to the Takitimus. These were the first taste of a more mountainous region. The sections with the long grass were some of my favourites. You could see a gust of wind gently sweep across the grass from far.

The first day was a long one (>30km) as you have to clear the Mount Linton Station in a single day and reach the Telford campsite. The last section seemed to stretch on and on - instead of being able to take a gravel road along the river the trail diverts you up a mountain with a several hundred meter climb. I heard that you used to be able to take the gravel through the private land, until a hiker vandalized a building and the section was shut. I haven't actually confirmed this, but I was cursing them while struggleing up the hill. In the end it was all worth it as I was rewarded with a sunset and rainbow over the mountains. It ended up being pretty common for the best experiences to shortly follow the worst hardships.

## Kepler Track

I diverted to Te Anau and did the Kepler great walk. Due to cost and availability you will almost certainly need to book a campsite as this is a popular great walk. However, do not let the popularity steer you away from it - it is completely worth the time.
