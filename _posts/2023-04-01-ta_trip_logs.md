This post is part of a short series that I wrote on hiking part of the Te Araroa trail in New Zealand.

These trip logs detail each section of the trip. I only walked the South Island, but did take any alternate routes that I thought were interested. As explained in the overview, I though of the TA as more of a guideline than a strict path to follow.
