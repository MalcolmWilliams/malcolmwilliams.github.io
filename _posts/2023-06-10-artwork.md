Over the years I hope to gradually improve my artwork. I'm primarily interested in sketching and painting, and often landscapes. These subjects tend to compliment my other hobbies such as hiking. 

When travelling I find a quick sketch to be the best way to capture an environment. The emotion of the scene can be replicated in a way that a quick photograph does not. Additionally, it forces you to actually sit down and _really_ observe the environment.

Just visible near the top of Spectacle hill is the [American Man](https://townofcupids.ca/spectacle-head-trail/). This was the subject of many dog walks. 

Earliest on I mostly did acrylic. Generally these would be done in one or two nights. Any larger projects feel too indimidating. I found I was pretty surprise with how much I liked working blending large blocks of colour.

I eventually moved a little more towards watercolour. I find it is faster and the equipment is much smaller. This makes it well suited to hiking and travelling. It is however less forgiving, but since I generally stick to very small work, this does not tend to be a huge problem.

I particularly enjoyed this circular series of watercolours. They were sized such that they could fit under the lid of a mason jar. They were given to friends and family along with homemade jam.

Most recently I have been focussing on pen. It is very unforgiving, but very satisfying. I have done some work in pencil, but find I struggle to get any clear drawings. Everything in pencil just dissolves into mush. With pen I am unable to do this.
