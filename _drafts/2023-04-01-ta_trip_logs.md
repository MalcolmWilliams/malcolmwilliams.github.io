This post is part of a short series that I wrote on hiking part of the Te Araroa trail in New Zealand.

Other posts can be found here:

These trip logs detail each section of the trip. I only walked the South Island, but did take any alternate routes that I thought were interested. As explained in the overview, I though of the TA as more of a guideline than a strict path to follow.

## Oreti Beach to Colac Bay
Part of the reason why I decided to go northbound was the easier start. The beaches don't receive much love as they are generally flat and deemed "uninteresting". They are flat, but the walking is easy as the sand is quite compacted. I would also say they are quite interesting - on your left you can see Stewart Island, and in the distance you can see the various hills slowly approaching.

## Longwoods and Takitimus
The Longwoods have quite a reputation for mud. This is certainly true, but depending on where else you have hiked in the world it is not anything unexpected. I was also passing through them towards the end of the season, so I suspect that it could have been worse. Additionally, some of the tops can easily get cloudy and have drastically reduced visibility. I did not have this occur to me, but could easily see how people could become lost. The trail was well marked with poles, but the path was not very visible due to the grass and fast growing bushes.

Shortly after Merrivale hut a friend and I tried our hands at hitching for the first time. It was a success - within a few minutes a kind gentleman from the Riverton bakery picked us up and offered some useful hints along the way. After the Birchwood Station and a stop in Nightcaps (with some restocking along the way) it was on to the Takitimus. These were the first taste of a more mountainous region. The sections with the long grass were some of my favourites. You could see a gust of wind gently sweep across the grass from far.

The first day was a long one (>30km) as you have to clear the Mount Linton Station in a single day and reach the Telford campsite. The last section seemed to stretch on and on - instead of being able to take a gravel road along the river the trail diverts you up a mountain with a several hundred meter climb. I heard that you used to be able to take the gravel through the private land, until a hiker vandalized a building and the section was shut. I haven't actually confirmed this, but I was cursing them while struggleing up the hill. In the end it was all worth it as I was rewarded with a sunset and rainbow over the mountains. It ended up being pretty common for the best experiences to shortly follow the worst hardships.

## Kepler Track

I diverted to Te Anau and did the Kepler great walk. Due to cost and availability you will almost certainly need to book a campsite as this is a popular great walk. However, do not let the popularity steer you away from it - it is completely worth the time. The trails are crowded and easy walking by TA standards. However, there are still sections that are almost completely deserted. The alpine sections were my favourite, and I actually opted to walk it twice. On the first day I left late in the afternoon as it was only a short walk to the Brod Bay campsite. The second day was longer as I skipped the Luxmore hut and went directly to the Iris Burn campsite. A detour to the caves and the summit of Mount Luxmore was certainly worthwhile. At the summit I saw my first Keas. On the third day I was originally planning to complete the loop via the river, however I enjoyed the alpine section so much I decided to instead retrace my steps. as I had to go all the way back to my hostel it was a longer day and my feet were very sore by the end. By the end I was regretting my decision to do the summit a second time.

## Mararoa River, Mavora Lakes and Routeburn

After a hitch from Te Anau I started the next section. There was nearly 40km of gravel road with limited water available. I enjoyed the almost hypnotic nature of the straight road and the solitude, but when I saw a car approaching decided to take my chances with a hitch. A lovely american couple picked my up - they were touring around the various Lord of the Rings filming locations, and just up ahead was the river Anduin and the breaking of the fellowship. The walk along the shore of the North Mavora Lake was very impressive - there was some trail, but mostly it was just along the gravel shores. There were signs of quads/motorcycles and just to the south was a popular campground, but I did not see any people. Exploring New Zealand by motorcycle would be fantastic to do one day.

I had brought enough food that I could extend the walk by a few days if desired. At this point I was still getting my legs under me, but feeling good. I'd succesfully hiked larger days that I had done in the past and was feeling fit and strong. At the Greenstone hut you have the option of folowing the TA which takes you to Elfin Bay on the shores of Lake Wakatipu, or you can follow the Greenstone Valley North West and join on to the Routeburn Great Walk. Having Enjoyed the Kepler and with the provisions to do so, I decided to take the latter option. I'd heard of a campsite off of the Routeburn which would allow me to stay without having to worry about reservations. Following the Caples Valley would have also been a reaonable alternative to the Greenstone Valley, but it was slightly further and did not offer any advantages that I could see. I camped at the Greenstone saddle, although I believe there were also options to camp at the site of the former McKeller hut. This hut had been taken out by a rock slide a few years earlier, so somehow this did not seem like the ideal location. Or perhaps that makes it a better location as maybe this means that the precipitous rocks had already precipitated.

DOC did choose aptly when they called the walks "great walks". Routeburn has some spectacular vistas from and approaching Conicle Hill. You can look all the way down the Holyford valley and out to the sea. There had recently been some cold weather and the taller mountains were still snow capped. Those mountains are normally glaciated, but a fresh snowfall is much nicer than a sad old grey glacier in my opinion. I later learned the "secret" campsite in the Valley of the Trolls was not actually so secret. A few weeks later I saw it on the front cover of a backpacking magazine from the early 2000's. Regardless, it was relatively easy to access being only a km or two past Lake Harris. The number of suitable camping locations is relatively limited as the ground is quite boggy. I only discovered it later, but the hike up to the further Lake Wilson would have provided a better camping location. On the day after I met a man starting the Serpentine Route. This is another one that I'd like to add to the list for later. Near the end of the route I met a fellow canadian who was kind enough to drive me to Queenstown - along the way he told me stories of his impressive 75km/16hr trail run in a park not far from my home. All of the incredible hiking on the other side of the world also reminded me that there are many incredible opportunities seemingly in my backyard.

## Motatapus

I had heard of an alternate route through cascade saddle - this is something I would have been very interested in pursuing, but ultimately decided not to. In the end this ended up being a good decision as I met a hiking partner in the Motatapus that I would not have otherwise met. The elevation profile of the hike shows what to expect in this section. It can be summarised as (up, down)x5. I found many other sections of the TA followed trails that were originally means of transport. They would follow the path of least resistance through the land, often down valleys next to rivers, and crossing valleys at the best saddle available. The Motatapus were different. From my understanding the trail and associated huts were developed as part of the lease agreement for the land. Famously by some dude that will be forever known as Shania Twain's ex husband. For this reason they certainly did _not_ follow the path of least resistance. However, I was not there to hike on flat ground. This was important to remind myself of when struggling up a hill and looking down at a road that would have been far easier.

## Breast Hill, Melinda Ridge and the Ahuriri river

Heavy rain was in the forcast so an extra day was spent in Wanaka. We then later hitched to Hawea and stayed at the holiday park by the lake. The Hawea holiday park is much better than the one in Wanaka, particularly if you are tenting. It's much more spacious and it's possible to get a great tent site by the lake. The next say was a sustained climb up Breast Hill. The view back on to Hawea lake was worth the effort. We were lucky to have great visibility, and it is billed as one of the best views on the TA for good reason. Despite the wind and the cold, we decided to camp out on the top of the hill for the sunset and sunrise. This really pushed the limits of my MacPac quilt. In the morning everything was frozen. I didn't remember any rain during the night (and I'm not sure I managed to sleep due to the cold), so I think that it was condensation from the clouds that moved in overnight and the morning dew. Since there was no force of the rain, the ice crystals were incredibly delicate and even.

After breast hill the TA follows the Timaru river, past Top Timaru hut, and up to Martha's Saddle. However, looking at the Topo maps there is an alternate route that can be taken along Melinda Ridge. I thought this looked like a quite interesting option but was already out of cell range so could not do much research. A few hours later I caught up to my hiking partner just before the junction and we decided to attempt it together. I fully comment on the route the TA actually follows, I'm sure it's wonderful, but I can say the ridge was spectacular. There are several peaks nearby that the ambitions can attempt. These include Mount Prospect and an unamed peak that is only 100-200m from the trail and should not be missed. After rejoining the TA we were met with the first major river crossing, the Ahuriri river. As the water levels were low and it was a 10km detour to a bridge we decided to cross. Some experimentation later and we felt ready to fully cross. The water level reached mid thigh and was swift, but it was very do-able. The descent into and out of the river valley was a great experience. You drop out of the mountains and into a perfectly flat plain that stretches several kilometers wide. Halfway through you stumble upon a deep cleft in the plain that the river has carved out. The valley appearing out of nowhere reminded me of the road into Drumheller, Alberta. After crossing the main river you follow an arm along a valley into Ohau. I had slightly miscalculated food and was out by this time. I'd also miscalculated the size of the Ohau... and the fact that it did not have a grocery store. The closest option was the Ohau lodge, and one of their three course meals. I think we may have brought the median age in the dining room down by 15 years, and may have raised some eyebrows with the atire, but the fodd was excellent. I had heard of their legendary nachos, but unfortunately arrived to late for these.

## Mt Cook, Ohau to Tekapo

The legal camping options from Ohau to Tekapo are slim. Some people opt to walk all day and night, some rent bikes. We couldn't secure bikes, so in the end we ended up hitching. However, before doing this we took a side tour to Mount Cook. In a perfect world this would have been excellent to bike. The couple that picked us up said there was one condition we would have to agree to - stopping at a lavender farm for icecream. This was OK by me. Lake Pukai is such a brilliant blue it is hard to believe, and the mountain valley surrounding the walk up to Mount Cook is quite surreal. We arrived later in the evening and decided to jog to Hooker Valley track at sunset. Why it's so popular during the day, and then empty at the most beautiful time is somewhat beyond me. As the tallest mountain in the country it has the interesting effect of being the last that the sun hits. This highlights just the snow capped peak and none of the surrounding lesser mountains. The moon came out from behind the mountain as well to complete the picture.

## Two Thumb Range, Stag Saddle

From the town of Tekapo you follow the eastern shore of the lake north before veering east into the Two Thumb Range. We camped a km or two from the city, and jogged back in the morning to throw out some glass beer bottles that we didn't want to carry. While running we ran into a hiker that was heading Northbound. We congratulated them on the progress so far. I'm not sure what she thought of two people running in the wrong direction without bags claiming to also be northbound hikers. We never caught up with her.

Progress up the lake was slow, however this just meant we had another excellent opportunity to camp near its shores. On the next day, we made it to Stag Saddle, the highest official point on the TA. Next to the saddle is Beuzenberg peak. As this is only a extra 150m climb but is the tallest peak nearby this is definitely worth it. Viewing the sunset from here was marvelous, but did mean that we had to setup camp in the bowl to the south of the saddle in the dark. The next morning the clouds rolled in and there was very limited visibility. Another reason to be grateful for the excellent weather so far. I didn't hear of anyone actually taking the "official" route along Camp Stream as opposed to the ridge to the saddle. We took the Forest Creek alternate route out to the Rangitata River. The weather was poor and it was a slog to exit. When we awoke the tops of the mountains were snow covered and we were in and out of the braiding river for the last 12km. One member of the group slipped and was completely soaked with the near freezing water. Thinking back now though it was a good experience, and the first cappuccino and excellent muffin at the cafe in Geraldine maybe made it all worth it.

## Arthur's Pass

A reader familiar with the TA might notice a large jump here. I'd heard varying accounts about the section between the Rangitata and Rakaia rivers. Some said it was "miss-able", some said it was their favourite sections. From what I could gather it was one of the sections that was the most frequently skipped. In the end the decision was made with time in mind. It would have been possible to complete the hike in time, but the schedule would have been more pressed, and I would not have had the flexibility to do additional side trips. From Geraldine we hitched to the town of Arthur's pass over the course of two days. Along we way we met a number of wonderful people, one of which invited us to stay at his family farm. A place so delightful should not be allowed to exist. At one point while touring the farm with the sun setting behind the mountains in the distance, half a dozen horses trotted up. They were retired race horses just living their best life.

After making it to Arthur's pass and unpacking our bounce boxes, we headed back south to rejoin the trail. People were rushing off it as there were heavy rains forecast for the next few days. However, we had packed far too much in our boxes and so would more than welcome being stuck being in a hut for a few days waiting for rivers to become cross-able. In the end it worked out perfectly, thanks to our poor packing.

At Goat Pass Hut there was a mountain radio with instructions for operation. I used it and requested a weather report. The response was so garbled there was no possible way it could be of use. After two attempts I thanked the kind operator and crossed my fingers. Cell service was available again near the Morrison footbridge so I was able to check in and get weather updates for the next few days. The trail heads east and follows the Taramakau river until Harpers pass. The trail kept disappearing, but it was a straightforward affair to just follow the river. Coming up to the pass the visibility started to get worse again and it started raining which turned in to snow higher on the mountains. We quickly hurried on to find warmer weather at the lower elevations. Perhaps too much time was spent in the forest taking pictures of the rain and sun in the trees. I experimented until my hands were too cold to pull the shutter.

After exiting we hitched to Hanmer Springs - the gentleman who picked us up was a wedding photographer who was on his way to shoot a wedding there. He was also going to be leaving at around the same time as us and so we ended up also getting a ride back with him. It was lovely listening to his stories of the number of times he had driven this route - he used to live in Christchurch and his girlfriend (now wife) in Nelson. The real highlight of Hanmer was not actually the hot springs (which I didn't end up visiting, but I'm sure would have been great), but the fish and chips place. Their Kumara chips (sweet potato fries) were the best I have ever had. We visited them 4 times in 2 days.

## Nelson Lakes

The overwhelming consensus for the "nicest stretch" of the TA is Nelson Lakes. That isn't to say that the other sections are not wonderful, but I can certainly understand why this is the generally accepted opinion. The mountains are taller, and when we were there snow capped, the plains are wide and the views stunning. We arrived at the Boyle River Outdoor Education center, repacked out food boxes and chowed down on the heavy food.

The only major deviation from the TA here was to stay at the Lake Guyon hut which was only 2-3 km off of the TA and on the border of a nice lake. There was some rain coming in so we wanted a hut to bunker down in. The rain continued strong for a full day and the next morning the landscape was transformed by the snow on the peaks. The mountains didn't change size, but their vastness was made really aparent by this change. Back on the TA the next feature was Waiau Pass. We had camped in a bowl a few kilometers from the pass, but still at around 1100m of elevation. We stopped just after a river crossing so our shoes were soaked, and in the morning they were completely frozen solid and you almost needed a crowbar to pry them open. I've certainly camped in colder weather and have dealt with similar, but I've never had my shoes completely saturated with water and then frozen. Even the laces were so still if you pulled them they would just stand out straight.  Regardless it was worth it for the views in the evening and the morning.

We approached the pass leisurely, debating whether to stop again for another coffee. We stopped to chat with a group that had just come over the pass and I think our leisurely attitude concerned them. We were told that we would not be so relaxed when we were climbing the pass, and they were right. Not because it was scary or difficult, but because it was good packing snow so of course there was a snowball fight. At the pass there is a peak that can be easily climbed for even better views down on to Lake Constance. Before crossing the pass there is also a small peak you can head back to for views down on to the valley that you came from. From there desending to Lake Constance and skirting its borders, and then dropped even lower to Blue Lake hut. This lake has the clearest fresh water of anywhere in the world. I did learn however that the visibility in salt water can actually be even higher than pure fresh water. There are some locations near Easter Island that exceed the visibilty of pure distilled water.

From here there are a few options to St Arnauds. The TA crosses Travers Saddle and then follows Travers River to the shores of Lake Rotoiti. Alternatively you can cross Travers Saddle and then take the Hopeless track up to Hopeless Hut. There is then a route to Angelus hut via Hopeless. As a final option you can instead forgo crossing Travers saddle and instead follow the Sabine River to Lake Rotoroa. From there you can take the Mount Cedric Track to Mt Cedric, and continue on to Angelus hut. Angelus sits on the edge of Angelus Lake at 1650m. From Angelus you can follow the Robert Ridge all the way to St Arnaud. We've been operating on the approach of ridge > valley, so the latter two options were more of interest. There was some poor weather coming in so Angelus via Cedric seemed like the easier option. Bookings are required for Angelus, but we suspected with the weather there would be some cancellations, which there were. Regardless we were prepared to camp if not. The visibility was poor as soon as we got above 1200m and the wind was strong. The climb up the Mt Cedric is short, but steep. We were almost on top of the hut before we could see it. We were able to secure a spot in the hut and were glad to warm by the fire as the wind blew outside. We could see a light faintly in the distance between sheets of rain. In the morning we went out and talked to the couple who had been camping - they hadn't realized there were empty spots in the hut, but they had survived the night no worse for wear and I'm sure have interesting stories out of it.

The hut warden had been helicoptered out earlier in the day. She had fallen and hit her head. She was fine until she fell again and hit her head again. The lady acting as warden was giving dire predictions for the weather the next day and was telling everyone to leave early and take the low route. The low route drops into a valley almost immediately and then follows a valley to St Arnaud. An older gentleman who had been hiking these mountains since before I was born and us decided to wait a little in the morning to see if the weather would improve. The hut emptied out at 7 am while I enjoyed my second cup of coffee and the rain poured down. I took the time to do some sketching, and by 10am the rain passed and the blue sky rolled in. We took the ridged down to St Arnaud and were very glad for the experience.

## Richmond Ranges

St arnaud is essentialy a resort town with a single lodge and a single expensive convenience store. I was continueing on to the Richmonds and stocked up on what I was missing from my food box. I also bought a touque and I was anticipating the weather to continue getting colder. I said goodbye to my hiking partner and continued out on my own. The Richmonds were billed as being the toughest section of the TA. I had been talking to an experienced local in Wanaka and had mentioned I wasn't sure about doing them. He was shocked that I would consider skipping it and strongly encouraged me to do it. I'm very glad that he did as it certainly gives Nelson Lakes a run for its money in terms of beauty. I also enjoyed how it was later in the season and there was no one about. I took the opportunity to sew the tread back on my shoes with dental floss. There was only a hundred or so kilometers remaining so I didn't want to buy new shoes that I was just going to immediately ruin.

From the Red Hill hut there is the Red Hills Ridge that you can take as an alternate to the TA. The wearhter was poor so I did not take it, but I regret missing the opportunity. I think that it would have felt close to Mars exploration with the vast and barren landscape. While I don't know if I'll ever get the opportunity to return, the area did remind me of the Tabledlands in Gros Morne National Park on the west coast of Newfoundland. I will be certainly returning there to hike it at some point so I don't think I will miss out too much. The route that the TA follows is still excellent, and shortly after crossing the ridge after Mt Elias (which is worth the detour to climb), you can follow a ridge up to the Red Hills. This only adds a few kilometers to the trip and is certainly worthwhile. Once you get to the saddle you can look down into the desolate red vally. The ridge continues to Maungakura, the tallest peak in the Red Hills. From here you are treated to a spectacular array of colours - the reds of the hills (which are well named), the lush greens of the valleys before you, the white caps of the mountains in the distance and the blue of the ocean to the west.

If I had to choose the most dangerous section of the TA I would say between Top and Mid Waiora hut. There are some relatively narrow paths along the cliffs which can be wet and eroded. None of the falls are too great, but certainly enough to be very problematic. The fact that you have just come from much larger vistas and larger looking falls might lure you into a false sense of security. Afterwards you come to the Rintouls. There was a petition on FarOut to build a suspension bridge between the two, and I'm ready to sign it. One of the reasons I really loved this section was the great run of peaks along the trail. Starting with Purple Top you then climb Mt Rintol and Little Rintoul, continue on to Old Man and Slaty, and then finish up with Starveall. I wanted to head to Nelson afterwards so I exited at Hackett hut and hitched in to the city. There I visited Pic's Peanut butter world where I petitioned them for a sponsorship. I hadn't seen anyone else carry a full KG tub of their peanut butter (not a pro ultralight maneuver), so I figured I could impress them with my dedication. They said they normally sponsor impoverished children and the like, but did take pity on me and give me a jar of peanut butter, so I can call myself a Pic's Peanut Butter sponsored athlete. Goal accomplished.

From Nelson I hiked a stretch of Able Tasman. After having just completed the Richmonds I found it crowded and uninteresting, but it is a very nice walk and the oppostunity to swim, relax and read on the beach was certainly appreciated.
