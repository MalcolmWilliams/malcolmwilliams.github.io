Hi - and welcome to my website!

I originally created this website to pull together my various projects into a portfolio that I could showcase during interviews. Since then I've cut away some of the cruft and hope to expand it further into other interests such as hiking, photography and art. 

### About Me
I studied Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Why Mechatronics? I was 17 and it sounded cool. I think it turned out to be a great fit for my interests and I've applied just about every aspect of the classwork in various personal projects or work.
